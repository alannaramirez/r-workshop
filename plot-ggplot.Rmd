## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

```{r}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


# Plots with ggplot2

We are going to make plots in r using the ggplot2 package from the tidyverse.

readxl: to read excel files (in many ways)
here: to help with filepaths

```{r setup, message=FALSE, error=FALSE}
library(tidyverse) #install.packages("tidyverse")
library(readxl) #install.packages("readxl")
library(here) #install.packages("here")
```

#California National Parks Data
```{r read-data}
ca_np <- read_csv(here("data/ca_np.csv"))

```
